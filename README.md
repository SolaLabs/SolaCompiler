# Sola Compiler - Version 1.0.0.2 Alpha (Release 2)

Welcome to the Sola Compiler! This application is designed to compile and execute scripts written in the Sola programming language. 
Please note, this project is still in development and all features are subject to change pending future updates.

Note: The Sola.app package is used for both macOS and Windows distributions. While '.app' is traditionally associated with macOS application bundles, Windows treats it as a standard folder. This unified structure avoids the need for platform-specific packaging and simplifies cross-platform setup and maintenance.

By keeping a consistent project layout, users on both platforms can follow the similar installation and deployment instructions without modification.
